# Reservoir_workflows
Perform workflows of Reservoir Engineering using Python.
Following approach will be used:
Production Datasets for 5 years in Excel were downloaded from https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/mprindex.asp
1. Datasets will be uploaded to colab working session
2. All the excel files will be converted to CSVs to work with files easily
3. All the CSVs will be combined to 1 consolidated production file
4. The consolidated CSV will be cleaned to ensure quality data is used for the Project

NOTE: Datasets will be custom cleaned as per the objectives of the Project.

Start with Decline Curve Analysis, then choose other workflows that can be automated.
